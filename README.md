# About the project

Workshop-Spring-Boot-Mongodb is a POO project from the course [DevSuperior](https://www.udemy.com/course/java-curso-completo/).

A really simple program that registrate user and posts, with each post having comments.
The main focus of the project is to introduce my self to mongodb and NoSQL Databases.

The security part is made entirely by me. (The course doesn't introduce this content).
